#  Sildish

Sildish language utilities, originally prototyped in Avail for rapid development, now ported to
iOS for convenient use.

The app presents a collection of tools, currently comprising:

1. A catalog of all Sildish phonemes, in Sildish alphabetical order.
2. A catalog of Roman monographs that correspond to Sildish digraphs.
3. A Roman-to-Sildish transliterator.
